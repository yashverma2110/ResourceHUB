## Idea behind- 
Coming from school we have the habit of being provided with books and all the
necsessary resources to start studying for the exams. In college it is not so. So to save your time in scrounging
for resources and googling stuff, this site has compilation of everything you'll need for the smooth sailing 
of your first year of college life. All the content which could be scavenged is here. If you want something to be added to the website, mail me at yash.silver2110@gmail.com
I have also added a important links section for the websites and 
stuff you all will need sonner or later. I hope sooner! This website was made by using HTML5, CSS3 Flexbox and Grid,
ReactJS and AOS. Please leave a star to the repository if this website was useful.
